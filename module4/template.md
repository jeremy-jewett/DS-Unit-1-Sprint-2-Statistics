# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
iracing stats

What do you know about?
where to get the dataset, 

What decisions do you face?
which classes to run?  Which division to race?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
The statistics of different regions could be tested.  We are placed into "clubs" based on such a location, so the data can be easily separated.  For instance, I am in the Ohio Club.  There is a New England club that encompases some northeastern states.  More research could be done to define them.

2. Trend related to the news
iRacing has gained popularity lately, based on the postponement of the NASCAR season (and others). Data containing sign-up dates could be useful - but may not be easily obtained.

3. Who does that?
The type of people in this hobby vary greatly in many aspects - including geo, age, sex, politics, etc.  It is something of a melting pot

4. Answering a question people care about
Why iRacing?  Will I ever get good?  Do people plateau?

5. Valuable to businesses
This would not really apply to the idea at hand - unless it were being used to consider which racer to sponsor for an upcoming event. Alternatively, for the iRacing company specifically, data could be used to determine longevity etc.

6. What's the most popular?
This could take the racing class into consideration by several breakdowns.  For instance, we could look at a certain type of race (i.e. "Dirt Oval"), or a specific car (i.e. Winged Sprint 305), or a specific track (i.e. Limaland Speedway).  Geography, too, could be considered.


7. Cost/Money rankings
Data on this particular factor would be limited to a consumer's knowledge of the prices for the various subscriptions.  This information may not be available readily for this particular situation.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

I've grown up around 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
